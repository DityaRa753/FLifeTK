# How to compile?
Just do in project root directory:

# Control(Just press a key):
By default, for make a cell need to press 'Mouse 1' or 'Mouse 2' at the field, but some keys override this behavior, switching them to hover mode. To cancel this mode, simply press this key again.

1. ESC(Escape) to exit;
2. 'Space' to pause;
3. 'c' to clear screen(kill all cells);
4. 'g' to hide grid(a slight lag is possible);
5. 'd' to drawing mode(hover);
6. 'e' to erase mode(hover), clear existing cells.
